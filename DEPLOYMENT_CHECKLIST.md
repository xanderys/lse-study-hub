- [ ] Support ready

### Launch
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. **Immediate Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous deployment in Vercel
   # Go to Deployments â†’ Previous â†’ Promote to Production
   ```

2. **Database Issues**:
   - Have database backup ready
   - Document restore procedure
   - Test restore process

3. **Critical Bugs**:
   - Hot fix branch
   - Quick fix and test
   - Deploy to production

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- âœ… All tests pass
- âœ… No critical errors in logs
- âœ… User can complete full workflow
- âœ… Performance metrics met
- âœ… Security checks pass

## Notes

- **Deployment Time**: ~5-10 minutes
- **First Build**: May take longer
- **DNS Propagation**: 5-30 minutes if using custom domain
- **Database Migration**: Automatic on first connection
